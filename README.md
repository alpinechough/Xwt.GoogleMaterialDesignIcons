# Xwt.GoogleMaterialDesignIcons
Google Material Design Icons for XWT and Mono.

## Material design icons
Material design icons are the official [icon set](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) from Google that are designed under the [material design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec).

Google has made these icons available for us to incorporate them into our products under the [Apache License Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt). Google would love attribution in our app's *about* screen, but it's not required. The only thing Google ask is that we not re-sell these icons.

## XWT
[XWT](https://github.com/mono/xwt) is a cross-platform UI toolkit for creating desktop applications with .NET and [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).
